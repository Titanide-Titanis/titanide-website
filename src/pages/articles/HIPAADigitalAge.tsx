            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" style={{ color: '#002B45' }}>HIPAA in the Modern Healthcare Landscape</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, has been the cornerstone of healthcare data protection for nearly three decades. However, the digital transformation of healthcare has created new challenges and complexities that extend far beyond the original scope of the legislation. The <em>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</em> reports that HIPAA violations have increased by 85% since 2020, largely due to digital healthcare adoption¹.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Today's healthcare organizations must navigate HIPAA compliance across cloud platforms, mobile applications, telehealth services, and AI-powered tools—technologies that didn't exist when the original regulations were drafted.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" style={{ color: '#002B45' }}>Digital Age Challenges</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Cloud Computing and Data Storage</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Cloud adoption in healthcare has accelerated dramatically, with <em>HIMSS</em> research showing that 95% of healthcare organizations now use cloud services in some capacity². However, cloud environments introduce complex compliance considerations around data location, access controls, and Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Organizations must ensure that cloud providers offer appropriate security measures, data encryption, and compliance support. The shared responsibility model means that while cloud providers secure the infrastructure, healthcare organizations remain responsible for data protection and access management.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Telehealth and Remote Care</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telehealth adoption by over 3,000%, according to <em>McKinsey Health Institute</em>³. This rapid expansion created new HIPAA compliance challenges around video conferencing platforms, remote monitoring devices, and patient communication tools.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Healthcare organizations must evaluate telehealth platforms for HIPAA compliance, implement appropriate security measures, and ensure patient data protection across all remote care touchpoints.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Mobile Health Applications</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Mobile health apps represent a significant compliance challenge. The <em>American Medical Association</em> estimates that over 350,000 health apps are currently available, but many lack appropriate HIPAA protections⁴. Healthcare organizations must carefully vet mobile solutions and ensure proper safeguards are in place.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" style={{ color: '#002B45' }}>Emerging Technology Considerations</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              AI and ML technologies offer tremendous potential for healthcare but introduce new HIPAA considerations. These systems often require large datasets for training and may create new forms of protected health information (PHI) through analytics and predictions.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              Organizations must implement appropriate de-identification procedures, ensure AI systems maintain data security, and consider the implications of algorithmic decision-making on patient privacy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Internet of Things (IoT) and Connected Devices</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Healthcare IoT devices, from smart medical equipment to wearable monitors, create new data collection and transmission pathways. <em>Deloitte</em> projects that healthcare IoT devices will reach 161 million units by 2025⁵. Each connected device represents a potential HIPAA compliance point that must be properly secured and managed.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" style={{ color: '#002B45' }}>Practical Compliance Strategies</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style={{ color: '#005870' }}>Comprehensive Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Modern HIPAA compliance requires ongoing risk assessment that encompasses all digital touchpoints. This includes:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Regular security vulnerability assessments</li>
